This package gives Eloquent models the ability to manage their friendships.
You can easily design a Facebook like Friend System.

## Models can:
- Send Friend Requests
- Accept Friend Requests
- Deny Friend Requests
- Block Another Model
- Group Friends

## Installation

First, install the package through Composer.

```php
composer require cuitcode/laravel-friendships
```

If you are using Laravel < 5.5, you need to add Cuitcode\Friendships\FriendshipsServiceProvider to your `config/app.php` providers array:
```php
Cuitcode\Friendships\FriendshipsServiceProvider::class,
```
Publish config and migrations
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Cuitcode\Friendships\FriendshipsServiceProvider"
```
Configure the published config in
```
config\friendships.php
```
Finally, migrate the database
```
php artisan migrate
```

## Setup a Model
```php
use Cuitcode\Friendships\Traits\Friendable;
class User extends Model
{
    use Friendable;
    ...
}
```

## How to use

## Friends
To get a collection of friend models (ex. User) use the following methods:
#### Get Friends
```php
$user->getFriends();
```

#### Get Friends Paginated
```php
$user->getFriends($perPage = 20);
```

#### Get Friends of Friends
```php
$user->getFriendsOfFriends($perPage = 20);
```

#### Collection of Friends in specific group paginated:
```php
$user->getFriends($perPage = 20, $group_name);
```

#### Get mutual Friends with another user
```php
$user->getMutualFriends($otherUser, $perPage = 20);
```

## Friend groups
The friend groups are defined in the `config/friendships.php` file.
The package comes with a few default groups.
To modify them, or add your own, you need to specify a `slug` and a `key`.

```php
// config/friendships.php
...
'groups' => [
    'acquaintances' => 0,
    'close_friends' => 1,
    'family' => 2
]
```

Since you've configured friend groups, you can group/ungroup friends using the following methods.

#### Group a Friend
```php
$user->groupFriend($friend, $group_name);
```

#### Remove a Friend from family group
```php
$user->ungroupFriend($friend, 'family');
```

#### Remove a Friend from all groups
```php
$user->ungroupFriend($friend);
```

#### Get the number of Friends in specific group
```php
$user->getFriendsCount($group_name);
```

### To filter `friendships` by group you can pass a group slug.
```php
$user->getAllFriendships($group_name);
$user->getAcceptedFriendships($group_name);
$user->getPendingFriendships($group_name);
...
```
